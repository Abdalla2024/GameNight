        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: <strong>August 2025</strong></p>

        <p>
          Party Games ("the App") is an iOS application designed for
          entertainment at social gatherings. We respect your privacy and are
          committed to protecting it. This policy explains what data we collect,
          how we use it, and your choices.
        </p>

        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>App data on device</strong>: Game selections, progression,
            and settings are stored locally on your device. We do not collect
            personally identifiable information from your device to our servers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>In‑App Purchases</strong>: Purchase transactions are
            processed by Apple via StoreKit. We do not receive your full payment
            details. We may receive non‑personal purchase validation data (e.g.,
            product identifier, transaction state) to unlock content.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Provide core functionality and unlock purchased content.</li>
          <li>Improve app stability and user experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
          We do not sell or rent your data. We do not share personal data with
          third parties except as necessary to process payments through Apple’s
          App Store or when required by law.
        </p>

        <h2>Analytics and Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          The App does not include third‑party advertising SDKs. If we add
          privacy‑preserving analytics in the future, we will update this policy
          and provide in‑app controls.
        </p>

        <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          The App is intended for users 13+ and may include optional mature
          content. If you are under the age required by your jurisdiction, use
          the App only with a parent or guardian.
        </p>

        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>
          We do not operate our own backend servers for this App. Purchases are
          handled by Apple. Any data processed by Apple is subject to Apple’s
          policies.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>You can delete the App to remove locally stored data.</li>
          <li>
            You can manage purchase history and refunds via your Apple ID
            account settings.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this policy from time to time. Material changes will be
          reflected on this page with an updated date.
