        <h2>3. In‑App Purchases</h2>
        <p>
          The App may offer optional content via in‑app purchases processed by
          Apple. All billing and refunds are handled by Apple under your Apple

          and may be subject to device/account limitations.
        </p>

        <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to misuse the App, attempt to reverse engineer, or use
          it in violation of applicable laws. Content you create or enter should
          respect others and local regulations.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The App, including content, graphics, and branding, is owned by the

          permission.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of
          any kind. We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error‑free operation.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any
          indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or
          loss of data or profits, arising from your use of the App.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate access to the App if you violate these
          Terms. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms periodically. Continued use after changes
          constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
